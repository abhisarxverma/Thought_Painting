A No Login, Secure, Simple, healing web app where you can *drop heavy thoughts* into an invisible grid, and later **see how your mind unfolded**—one thought at a time.

> “Even when I write, I hide things between the lines.”

## ✨ What is Thought Painting?

Thought Painting is a black-screen canvas with invisible boxes where you can freely place your thoughts—no pressure, no rules. It's for those late-night mental weight moments when you just need to **get it out**.

Every thought you add builds a **progression**, a silent story of what your mind has been carrying. Below the main 4x4 grid, there's a **"Thought Canvas"**—a bigger space where you can freely extend the layout and even create **entire new canvases**.

## 💡 Why I Made This

I built this while I'm still learning—just using the skills I know: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.  
No libraries, no fancy framework. Just me, trying to make something real for people like me.

It’s imperfect. It’s mine. It’s honest.  
And I hope it gives someone comfort.
